# traffic-optimizer

- Traffic signal timings in a road network can not only affect total user travel time and total amount of traffic emissions in the network but also create an inequity problem in terms of the change in travel costs of users traveling between different locations .Traffic congestion in peak hours in major cities of Delhi, Mumbai ,Kolkata and Bengaluru costs the economy 1.47 lakh crores annually.

- Due to heavy amount of traffic ambulances must suffer a lot. Every minute is critical for a patient and getting stuck in traffic for long hours further deteriorates their condition.

- The project deals with optimizing traffic signal time such that it is optimally divided amongst all the roads connected to that traffic light. In this way, the time is divided based on the density of traffic on the roads.
